//PHP Car Rental app

Main Idea; Create an app that connects to a datbase, and adds used cars to the database. The database will take the make, model, year and mileage and asking price  of each car and store it in a databse.

-extra ideas
	-each car will increase mileage every week due to test drives
	-based on mileage and age, the asking price will go down over time
	-every month there will be a chance that the car will be sold based 	     on price, mileage and age
	-every 15 miles decreases the cars price by 100 dollars
	-every year decreases the cars price by 500 dollars
